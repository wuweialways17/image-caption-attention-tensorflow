# Image Captioning
Image Captioning using RNN + CNN architectures on benchmark Flick8r dataset.

## Dataset
[Flickr8k](http://www.jair.org/papers/paper3994.html): M. Hodosh, P. Young and J. Hockenmaier (2013) "Framing Image Description as a Ranking Task: Data, Models and Evaluation Metrics", Journal of Artifical Intellegence Research, Volume 47, pages 853-899."  
This dataset is freely available upon request, but cannot be redistributed, hence no download scripts in the repo.
